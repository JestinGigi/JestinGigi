### @Red Lions Controls AS Devops Intern
During my tenure of 6 months, I established a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of flashing firmware to products and implementing testing stages for the devices. Was able to get hands-on on Linux, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and Terraform. Gained a comprehensive understanding and implementation of DOOD and DIID concepts. Effectively managed VMs using Ansible and built and executed Docker images. Deployed VMs and S3 buckets through Terraform configuration files.

### @ Hack X Security As Security Intern
**VAPT Project:** During my internship at Hack X Security, I actively participated in a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) project. I gained hands-on experience in identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, and systems.  
  - Coded some automation scripts for integrating paramspider and XSpear in bash 
  - Learned new vulnerabilities and explored automated tools for vulnerability testing  

## üìöAchievements & Projects

- **Linux File Systems:** With 2+ years of experience working with Linux, I have a deep understanding of Linux file systems, command-line operations, and system administration tasks.

- **Bug Bounty Reports:** I have written approximately 52 reports on private bug bounty programs, where I discovered and responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities to organizations, helping them improve their security posture.

- **Machine Learning:** I have successfully developed a stock forecasting application using Dash, Plotly, HTML, and CSS. The application utilizes machine learning models like Support Vector Regression to forecast future stock prices. To optimize the machine learning models, I employed the RBF kernel in GridSearchCV.

- **Chatbot Development:** I developed a chatbot using NLP techniques and Flask framework. It provides an interactive interface for users to ask questions and receive responses based on natural language processing algorithms using the dataset given to it.
